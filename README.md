## Notes

Throughout the process of building this app, the biggest challenge for me was revisiting concepts that I have learned about Website Development. Majority of my time was spent reviewing the concepts again. After the review everything was alot more smoother. Additionally, finding the passkeys was a fun motivation as each challenge unlocks the key. At the end of the day, this was a great learning experience and I can't wait to learn the next step.
